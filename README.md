# Reddit-Stocks-Data-Collector

Uses PRAW: The Python Reddit API Wrapper  to scrape a subreddit of your choosing to see what stocks are being talked about. Practically useless but I made it for practice. Also asks for "sample size" which 
is just how many reddit posts you want to scan. Of course, the higher the number, the longer it will take for the program to run.

I plan on eventually refining it, adding a comments feature so it also scans comments. There are also a lot of stocks that share their symbol with common words, so I will have to 
expand my "useless" words dictionary to filter those out. Also a feature that scrapes all stocks subreddits might also be interesting.

## Example 

>What subreddit do you want to scrape?: **WallStreetBets**

>Sample Size? **100**

> **Output** ALL 1
